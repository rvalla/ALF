Here are some results for little challenges. Sometimes to compare different ways of solving the same problem. The
available files are:

- *fibonacci.py*: functions to work with elements of the *Fibonacci sucession*.
- *checkmail.py*: looking for a fast way to check if an email address is valid.
- *guessqrt.py*: having fun trying to guess square roots.
- *randomsequences.py*: functions to get random lists of numbers.
